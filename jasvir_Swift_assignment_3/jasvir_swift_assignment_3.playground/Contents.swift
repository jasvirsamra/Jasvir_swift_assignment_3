/* Create a super class named Ship
Create a subclass named CruiseShip
Create a subclass named CargoShip
Create a subclass named PirateShip
the classes should have the following details:
Ship (superclass)
name
year
countryOfOrigin
add an appropriate initializer
CruiseShip (subclass)
maxCapacity
oceanOfOperation
currentPassengerCount
add a method to add a passenger if the ship is not at max capacity
add a method to print the current passenger count
CargoShip (subclass)
maxCargoCapacity
currentCargoCount
isInternational
add a method to add cargo if the ship is not at max capacity
add a method to print the current cargo count
PirateShip (subclass)
maxTreasureCapacity
currentTreasureCount
numberOfCannons
add a method to add treasure if the ship is not at max capacity
add a method to print the current treasure count
Create an instance of 1 of the subclasses and using print statements, demonstrate the use of ALL the properties and methods of that class as well as the superclass üõ† you can do this anyway you like, but all props and methods must be demonstrated üëç
